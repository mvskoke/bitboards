# bitboards

I made this repo to experiment with bitboard functionality.

While working on my cchess project, I quickly realized the
importance of effectively testing and assessing my code for
bitboards. I also realized how large this code module would
be, so I began working in a separate repo in case anything
went horribly wrong. I didn't want to risk messing up
my cchess repo.
